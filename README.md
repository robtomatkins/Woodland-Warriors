# **WOODLAND WARRIORS**
## HTML & CSS Portolio Project
<br>
Woodland Warriors is a three page, fully respsonsive, informational site for people looking to join organised voluntary litter picking walks, in woodland and park areas around London and Greater London. This site was created as a milestone project - the aim being to create a static front-end site to present useful information to users.
<br>
The goal of the site is to increase volunteer signups to support Woodland Warriors reach its organisational goals of cleaning up woodland and park areas in London and Greater London. The site does this by providing information about upcoming Woodland Warriors walks, general information about the orgnisation such as the mission and values, and a sign up form for users to register thier interest.

# <a name="section-1"></a> UX

- ## Overview 
    - The site has been designed to be visually striking and simple to navigate, with all three pages linked via anchor links in thier sections, and the navigation bar which sits at the top of each page.
    <br>
    Design elements run consistently throughout all three pages, such as the hero image (different image but same size), navigation bar, footer and colour scheme. The 'walks' and 'about' section both have the same layout but have different imagery for the text box backgrouds. 
<br>
<br>

- ## Colour Story 
    - #30302f
        - Dark Grey for fonts
<br>
<br>
    - #9cb466
        - Green to tie in with woodland theme
<br>
<br>
    - #eeeeee - off white as less harsh option to full white
<br>
<br>
    - rgba(33, 33, 33)
        - Converted to rgba from #30302f using [RGBA Color Picker](https://rgbacolorpicker.com/rgba-to-hex) so I could apply as transparent overlay and background
<br>
<br>
    - rgba(156, 180, 102) 
        - Converted to rgba from #9cb466 using [RGBA Color Picker](https://rgbacolorpicker.com/rgba-to-hex) so I could apply as transparent overlay and background

- ## Fonts
    - Downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Roboto (body) and Prompt (headings) were used at various weights throughout site. Roboto was used for the body and Prompt for the headings - these fonts were chosen as they visually compliment eachother well. 

- ## Images
    - Images were obtained from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

- ## Hover Attributes 
    - Hover attributes were a design choice to create interactivty, and to highlight links or information of importance, such as the links to [Woodland Trust](https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/) in the walks section. 

- ## Anchor Links
    - Anchor Links were used a design choice to asist with navigation on the site and also for the social media links and to provide further information in the 'walks' section.
